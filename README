This repository contains all the metabolic maps extracted from the UCSD SBRG BIGG database.

Maps in the directory `v0.3` can be viewed using the metabolic_map function in Escher version <= 0.3.

Maps in the directory `v1.0` can be loaded in the Escher Builder, or using the escher.Builder() constructor.


This repository is here for historical purposes, but all maps are now being stored on the Escher website in this repository: https://github.com/escher/escher.github.io
